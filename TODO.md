- Opening empty new notebooks doesn't work. Should also support creating new notebooks from ST
- Support set_next_input
- Correctly handle 'dead' message from the kernel
- Add support for creating/renaming notebooks
- Add an option of saving a backup copy of notebook json file (use git to have all copies?):
    - For now it is possible to use inb_open_as_ipynb command
- Use scopes to highlight python code only inside input cells
- Put feedback from the notebook in status bar (on save etc.)
- Completion on file names and directories should work better
